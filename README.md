This comprehensive approach ensures that the projected profits are accurate and reflective of real-world trading conditions.

**5. Risk Management** - To mitigate potential risks, the bot incorporates risk management protocols. This includes setting threshold limits for minimum profit margins and avoiding trades that fall below these predefined levels. Additionally, the bot monitors market volatility and adjusts its trading parameters accordingly.
